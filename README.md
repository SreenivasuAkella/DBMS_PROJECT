Airport Database Management System
This project is designed to manage and interact with an airport's database system. It provides functionalities for adding, updating, and retrieving various types of information related to flights, passengers, and airport management operations.

Features
1. Flight Management
Add Flight Information: Allows users to input details such as flight number, departure/arrival times, destination, and status (e.g., on time, delayed, or canceled).
Update Flight Information: Users can update existing flight details, including changes to flight times, statuses, gates, and terminals.
Retrieve Flight Information: Fetch flight details based on criteria such as flight number, destination, or airline, and display detailed information about the selected flight.
2. Passenger Information Management
Add/Update Passenger Records: Allows users to input new passenger data, such as name, ticket number, flight association, and seating details. Existing passenger information can be updated as needed.
Retrieve Passenger Information: Search and display details of a passenger using filters such as name or ticket number.
Booking and Ticket Management: Keeps track of passenger bookings and ticket statuses (e.g., confirmed, canceled), and provides options to update or modify this information.
3. Airport Operations Management
Resource Allocation: Manages airport resources, including terminals, gates, and runways. The system optimizes resource allocation based on real-time flight schedules.
Staff Management: Stores and manages staff schedules, assignments, and operational duties.
Logistics and Ground Operations: Helps manage logistics, including baggage handling, fuel allocation, and ground operations for flights.
4. Database Interaction
The system interacts with a SQL-based database for secure storage and retrieval of flight, passenger, and operational information.
Error handling and validation mechanisms ensure that invalid data is not entered into the database.
CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations are implemented for managing data in all modules.
